# What's new in V2

After using our own extension a bit, we noticed some big improvments were needed.  
We came up with the following new improvments:  
 - V1 projects are still supported.  
 - Only V2 projects will enjoy the followings improvments
    - Scrap an URL several times with different parameters.  
    - Parameters for URLs can be static or dynamic by getting them from your server right before scrapping a page.  
    - Using a switch, you can decide to automatically send the data to your server after each iteration of scrapper.js.  
    - In the left panel, you can now schedule your projects to run at different interval automatically
    - Clicking on the [RUN ON  ALL URLS....] button, will now run scrapper.js in a seperate tab, and  automatically close it at the end.  
    - Using rws.manualActionRequired("..."), will now open in a seperate tab.
